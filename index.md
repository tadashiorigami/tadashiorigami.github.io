## Credit card risk analysis

### Adaptive decision tree

I developed a custom decision tree algorithm to optimize profits on credit card chargeback data. <br>
By utilizing entropy to classify data at the early stages and maximizing profit gain at the terminal nodes, the adaptive decision tree improved the profits generated by the test samples.<br>
This project demonstrates how custom machine learning techniques can improve the solutions on business problems.<br>

### Adaptive random forest 

An adaptation for the adaptive decision tree, generating a tree ensemble to make better predictions. <br>
In comparison with the XGB model, after balancing the data by oversampling with Smote, the XGB predictions had a slightly worse profit performance, but higher F1, accuracy, recall and training speed.

## Property rental price analysis

Using some training data from Datacamp, in this notebook I do the ETL and the exploratory analysis on hotels and houses rental prices in San Francisco.<br>
Feature engineering region clusters and characteristics, I create a base model based on linear regression and compare with regression trees and XGB.<br>
To deeper understand the model's performance and what to expect from the model, I also plot the hotels on San Francisco's map to check how to improve the input data and model.<br>

## Data Analysis

## Brazilian election fraud analysis

In 2022 there was a big discussion about "fraud in Brazil's election". The claim was based on the fact that there was an imbalance in the number of voting sections with 0 votes on Bolsonaro (144 sections) and with 0 votes on Lula (5 sections)<br>
If the sampling from each voting section was random, the voting urns would approach a normal curve (CLT theorem).<br>
In my exploratory analysis, I find the reasons why this is possible by pointing the bias source on these sections.<br> 
Below, you can find the link for the github notebook in Portuguese and the Medium article in English.
